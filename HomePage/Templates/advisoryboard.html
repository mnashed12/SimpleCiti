      As the Founder and Managing Partner of <strong>Cherry Lawn Capital</strong>, Robby McDonald leverages his combined experience in real estate and venture capital to design capitalization structures that support the asset origination and business scaling efforts of real estate technology startups. These structured finance solutions—encompassing senior, mezzanine, and equity products—provide an innovative alternative to traditional closed-ended funds. They incorporate standard investment features (e.g., GP catchups, clawbacks, hurdle structures) while capturing value from the startup’s accelerated growth.
      <br><br>
      Prior to this, Robby served as Venture Development Lead at <strong>Stackpoint Venture</strong>, a VC firm focused on the creation of real estate technology businesses. In that role, he observed a recurring challenge: startups, pressured to scale rapidly, often had to assume real asset exposure, creating misalignment between venture and real estate capital. To solve this, Robby developed a unique asset-backed credit structure—an innovation that became the foundation for launching Cherry Lawn Capital.

His early experience includes advisory and analytical roles at boutique financial firms and brokerage houses, where he developed a deep understanding of institutional real estate capital markets—both at the asset level and the capital vehicle level. He has worked with a wide variety of complex structures including programmatic JVs, closed and open-ended funds, and co-investment vehicles across multiple asset classes.
