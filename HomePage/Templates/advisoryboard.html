                  square feet of retail, office, and self-storage properties. In addition to portfolio-wide

              As the <u>Founder</u> and <u>Managing Partner</u> of <strong>Cherry Lawn Capital</strong>, Robby McDonald 
              leverages his combined experience in real estate and venture capital to design 
              capitalization structures to support the asset origination and business scaling efforts 
              of real estate technology startups.<span class="hidden-text"> These structured finance solutions, encompassing 
              senior, mezzanine, and equity products, provide an innovative alternative to traditional 
              closed-ended funds, incorporating standard investment features (e.g., GP catchups, 
              claw backs, hurdle structures) while capturing value from the startup’s accelerated 
              growth. Prior to this, Robby served as <u>Venture Development Lead</u> at <strong>Stackpoint 
              Venture</strong> – a VC firm focused on the creation of real estate technology businesses. In this 
              role, he observed a recurring challenge with many startups in the industry: compelled 
              by their business models and under pressure to scale rapidly, they faced the necessity 
              of assuming real asset exposure. This dynamic often led to misalignments between 
              venture and real estate capital, which existing solutions failed to remedy. To address 
              this issue, Robby developed a unique asset-backed credit structure that inspired the 
              launch of Cherry Lawn Capital.
              <br><br>Prior, Robby was at <strong>Goldman-backed Entera Technologies</strong>, where he advanced 
              data-driven investment strategies and traditional real estate investment firms (such 
              as Amherst Holdings, where he spearheaded the buildout of a portfolio acquisitions 
              strategy which ultimately resulted in a $1B+ equity fund dedicated to the strategy). His 
              early experience includes advisory and analytical positions at boutique financial firms 
              and brokerage houses, which contributed to a deep understanding of institutional real 
              estate capital markets at both the asset and capital vehicle-level. He has experience 
              working with a variety of complex capital vehicle structures (programmatic JVs, closed 
              and open-ended fund structures, co-investment funds, etc.) across a number of real 
              estate asset classes. Robby holds a B.A. from <strong>Williams College</strong>.</span>
