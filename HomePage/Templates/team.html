    Shervin is the driving force behind a network of 17 operating and holding companies under the SimpleCITI Companies
    umbrella. As the head of SimpleCITI Holdings, his strategic vision and operational expertise have positioned him
    as an emerging figure in the real estate, advisory, and asset management sectors. He predominantly focuses on
    SimpleEQUITIES, SimpleADVISORY, Real Estate OpCos, while maintaining rigorous oversight of the Family Office
    HoldCos. His leadership is characterized by a relentless pursuit of innovation and uncompromising regulatory
    compliance. At SimpleADVISORY, Shervin shapes the firm’s Registered Investment Advisor (RIA) services, managing
    both proprietary portfolios and externally allocated funds. He seamlessly integrates market insights with cutting-edge investment strategies. His profound understanding of economic cycles and regulations enables him to craft
    sophisticated financial products tailored to institutional investors.

  <p class="bios slide-in">
      With more than 30 years of experience in real estate acquisition, development, underwriting, and operations,
    Shervin’s influence permeates every aspect of SimpleCITI’s business. His business acumen extends to manufacturing,
    with the founding of USN Corp, a consumer-packaged goods vertically integrated powerhouse relied upon by
    Fortune 500 National Brands and Retailers, that he scaled from inception into a global force of quality and efficiency.
    Under Shervin’s vision and leadership, the company grew from inception to employ 1,700 U.S. workers and operate
    22 North American facilities—many of them Greenfield developments several of which Shervin himself purchased,
    engineered, and developed. Shervin was also responsible for multiple mergers & acquisitions for USN, helping to
    drive further growth of the business. Shervin’s expertise in navigating complex regulatory frameworks has enabled
    him to engage seamlessly with 18 federal regulatory agencies and bodies, including the ATF, CDC, DEC, EPA, FDA,
    DOT, DHHS, and OSHA, ensuring all operations meet or exceed compliance standards. Notably, he was credited
    with building the North American facility that led to Johnson & Johnson relocating 100% of production for brands
    like Neutrogena, Aveeno, Clean & Clear, and Johnson’s Baby from the UK to North America. This was achieved by
    creating a state-of-the-art, FDA-compliant robotic manufacturing facility and improving formulas and substrates,
    resulting in a 10-year exclusive contract worth $800 million high margin dollars.
  </p>
  <p class="bios slide-in">
      A graduate of New York University’s Leonard N. Stern School of Business with a B.S. in Finance and International
    Business, Shervin’s sharp intellect and commanding presence have not only transformed industries but also cemented
    his role as a leader of immense influence. Beyond his corporate achievements, he is a committed philanthropist and
    serves as a dedicated Board Member and Vice President at Beth Hadassah and a former Board Member of USN and
    Radienz Living. Shervin has been married for 25 years, with five children and resides on Long Island.
